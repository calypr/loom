# Explorer dataframe backlog

The product goal is a researcher-facing workflow that turns nested, sparse
FHIR data into understandable, reproducible training tables. Scalar-shaped
columns alone do not establish that a dataset is suitable for machine learning.

Use the [local development workflow](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) to implement each
slice. Extend its real browser scenario with the expected user outcome, then
run it against the live backend. Improve the harness when a feature needs it;
do not make further harness polish a prerequisite for product work.

## Delivery order

| Priority | User outcome | Current gap | Live acceptance case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Know when joining related records loses values | Scalar child fields can use `FIRST`, while the contract still reports lossless and ML-ready | Give one Patient two Observations. Selecting their value must not silently publish a supposedly lossless table that drops one. Explain the ambiguity and require an explicit policy, or clearly report the loss. |
| 2 | Choose how repeated values become columns | Builder submits the candidate's default projection without a visible choice | Choose between separate scalar columns, an array, and an explicitly lossy first value. Preview and the contract must agree with that choice. |
| 3 | Create meaningful derived features | Backend types include aggregates and typed lookups, but Builder commands/controls mainly create field selections | Author a related-record count through the UI, publish it, and verify the exact count in Viewer and CSV. Expand later to concept, unit, and time-window rules. |
| 4 | Judge coverage before training | Preview shows null cells without feature-level missingness or cohort effects | Show populated/total rows and missingness for each chosen feature, including an all-null feature and the effect of a filter. |
| 5 | Understand and reproduce an exported table | CSV uses physical names; paginated export is not visibly pinned to one publication | Export data with a manifest mapping names, meanings, types, null rules, filters, generation, and receipt. Verify all pages use the same publication. |

## First slice

Start with priority 1. The UI should explain the consequence in researcher
language, for example, "Some patients have more than one observation. Choose
how those observations become a feature." Detailed FHIR paths belong in an
expandable explanation, not in the only actionable message.

The next fixture must contain multiple related records. The existing fast
fixture intentionally has one Observation per Patient, so its green result
does not prove that this gap is fixed.

## Source evidence

- [Child-field rendering](../internal/dataframe/compiler/render/aql/navigation_render.go)
  reduces scalar child sets with `FIRST(FLATTEN(...))`.
- [Semantic compilation](../internal/explorer/compilation/semantic_compile.go)
  classifies indexed fields from their internal array boundaries; that does
  not prove one-to-one relationship cardinality.
- [Authoring commands](../internal/explorer/authoringv2/commands.go) and
  [column selection](../ui/packages/loom-ui/src/features/ExplorerBuilder/components/ColumnSelector.tsx)
  are the current field-authoring boundary.
- [The contract panel](../ui/packages/loom-ui/src/features/ExplorerBuilder/components/DataframeContractPanel.tsx)
  is the existing place to surface output shape and losslessness.
- [Viewer export](../ui/packages/loom-ui/src/api.ts) fetches pages and constructs
  CSV in the browser. [Dataframe resolution](../internal/api/graphql/graph/dataframe/service.go)
  resolves the current materialization for a request.

The multi-page republish risk is inferred from the current selector flow, not
reproduced by the synthetic browser scenario. Authentication, real-data scale,
charts, pagination, and richer clinical semantics remain separate coverage.
